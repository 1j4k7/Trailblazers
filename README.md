Code for the Mini Urban Lego Robotics Competition using an EV3 Lego Robot core.

JRE - 1.8
Uses the leJOS library, please read up and install from http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Home/ (requires an SD card for the robot)

If there are any problems with the code/formatting, please open an issue when possible. We don't want to be editing a file back and forth. Also, starting today, Code changes to master should bedoen via pull request from branches, preferrably from the alpha branch (more branches to come).
